<center>Bowling Database/Statistics Management</center>
<p>
The guts of the project is most definately the database, so I'll start by showing you it's basic shape.  Next I'll move on to layout the scripts that will make up the backbone of the project and what functionality they will provide.
</p>
Database Layout:

Scripts:
<p>
<b>index</b>: The splash page, lists all users, lists 10 best averages, and 10 best games<
<p>
<b>header/footer</b>: Connects to the database, and includes functions useed on each page: player(), user(), admin() creates links at top of pages.
<p>
<b>login/logout</b>: Used to create and destory user sessions.
<p>
<b>scoring.js</b>: has javascript functions for scoring games as they are entered/edited.
<p>
<b>game</b>: Takes a value for how many players are in this game.  Creates a HTML table row with the scoring form inside it.  The form submits to <b>gamesubmit</b>.  The form is verified and scored by JavaScript.
<p>
<b>gamesubmit</b>: Inserts, updates, or deletes infromation into the database.
<p>
<b>gameedit</b>: Gathers game info from the database by game_id, fills the values for an HTML form.  Submits to 
<b>gamesubmit</b>.  It also offers the option of deleting the game being edited.
<p>
<b>result</b>: Takes a value game_id and displays that game in HTML tables.
<p>
<b>statistics</b>: Will probably be written in PERL, for it's heavy lifting.  Querys the database, finding statistics for strikes, spares, spare conversions, etc.
<p>
<b>usersgames</b>: Takes a value uid and lists games for the player with that uid in the <i>users</i> table.  Allows some sorting, and displays rudimentary statistics.
<p>
<b>users</b>: Adds, edits, or deletes users.  When a user is deleted all their games go too.
<p>
<b>standings</b>: Ranks users by averages, total pinfall, maybe other criteria.
