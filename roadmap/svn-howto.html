A brief intro to Subversion(SVN)<p/>
Subversion is a tool that simplifies collaberation on a software project.  You use a SVN client to "check out" files from a SVN server.  You edit the local files, and when you're done doing that you will use your SVN client to "commit" the changes to the server.  The server logs all the changes and at any point you can check out code from previous revisions.<p/>

To familiarize you with how to use SVN on this project I'm going to give you a short list of things to do:

<ol>
	<li>Download <a href="http://tortoisesvn.sourceforge.net/">TortoiseSVN</a>, and install it.  It will ask you to restart, you'll need to.  Now when you right-click you'll be able to access SVN options for folders and files.</li>
	<li>Create a folder where you'd like to check the <i>bdsm project</i> files into. <b>Note:</b> It is important that this folder be empty, or you will wind up adding unwanted files into the SVN repository.</li>
	<li>Right-click on the folder you have created.  Choose <i>SVN Checkout...</i></li>
	<li>There are several fields here for the <i>URL of repository</i> enter <i>https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/bdsm/</i> and for <i>Checkout Directory</i> there are two checkboxes, leave them blank. For the <i>Revision</i> options we want to select <i>HEAD</i>.  Click <i>Ok</i></li>
	<li>This may take a moment, it will mention what files it grabbed.  Go ahead and close this window once it's done.(click ok)</li>
	<li></li>
</ol>
