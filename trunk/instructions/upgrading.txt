
Requirements:
This bowling database doesn't need a whole lot, but you will need:
  PHP version 4 or greater.
  MySQL version 3 or greater.

updating from v0.2 to v0.9:
IMPORTANT!:  Please, please backup your existing database using 'mysqldump'.  These instructions should work seamlessly, but you don't want to lose your existing games.

1.) First you will need  a MySQL user who can UPDATE the database.

2.) At the command line go to the directory where you saved the file "update.sql"(in the database folder of this archive) you'll need to type:

  mysql -u username -h hostname -p databasename < update.sql

3.) Now when you "Add Game" you'll have the option to track pinfall in new games.

DETAILS:

If the instructions above doesn't work for you, restore your database from the backup you made at the start, then alter the table to match the instructions below.

1.) Alter games adding a tinyint(1) "track_pins", that is not null with a default value of 0.

2.) Alter pinfall changing the field "frame" to "rack".

3.) Alter pinfall dropping "b1", "b2", and "b3".

4.) Alter pinfall adding ten fields of tinyint(4) that default to null, named "pin1" through "pin10".
